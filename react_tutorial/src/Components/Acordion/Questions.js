    'question':'What is React?',
    'answer':'React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It was developed by Facebook and is widely used for creating interactive UI components.'
},
{
    'id':2,
    'question':'What are React hooks?',
    'answer':'React hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 as a way to add stateful logic to functional components without needing to convert them into class components.'
},
{
    'id':3,
    'question':'What is JSX in React?',
    'answer':'JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript files. JSX makes it easier to define UI components by combining JavaScript and HTML syntax.'
},
{
    'id':4,
    'question':'What are keys in React and why are they important?',
    'answer':'Keys are special string attributes that provide a unique identity to each element in a list in React. They help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed in a list, and thus improve performance and efficiency when rendering lists of components.'
},
{
    'id':5,
    'question':'What is the purpose of setState() in React?',
    'answer':'setState() is a method used to update the state of a component in React. When you call setState(), React re-renders the component and its children with the updated state. It is the primary way to manage component state in React.'
},
{
    'id':6,
    'question':'What are controlled components in React?',
    'answer':'Controlled components are form elements (like input, textarea, and select) whose value is controlled by React state. In a controlled component, the value of the form element is set by the state and any changes to the value are handled by React, making it easier to manage form data in React applications.'
